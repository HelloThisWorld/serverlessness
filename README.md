# Serverlessness
100% serverless AWS based high availability and high performance system design.

## Basic concept



### What is serverless

**Serverless computing** is a [cloud computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing) [execution model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Execution_model) in which the cloud provider runs the [server](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_(computing)), and dynamically manages the allocation of machine resources. Pricing is based on the actual amount of resources consumed by an application, rather than on pre-purchased units of capacity.[\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serverless_computing#cite_note-techcrunch-lambda-1) It can be a form of [utility computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utility_computing).

Serverless computing can simplify the process of [deploying code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_deployment) into production. Scaling, capacity planning and maintenance operations may be hidden from the developer or operator. Serverless code can be used in conjunction with code deployed in traditional styles, such as [microservices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microservices). Alternatively, applications can be written to be purely serverless and use no provisioned servers at all.[\[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serverless_computing#cite_note-lambda-api-gateway-2)

This should not be confused with computing or networking models that do not require an actual server to function, such as [peer-to-peer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer-to-peer) (P2P).

### What is this project doing

To prove the possibility of create a real life web application by using as much as possible of the serverless service provide by AWS.

The project will basis on a real business requirement from small business owner usage, such as pet grooming service owner. 

I'm not good at UI/UX design, the interface may not fancy. Major the functionality will in backend.

This project will use a [Event-driven_architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event-driven_architecture). Related CQRS(Command query responsibility segregation), Message queue, Lambda, etc.



Hope you have a fun with this project.
